About ViewBindings
==================

ViewBindings provides unidirectional data binding from MVC's Models to MVC's Views.
Typically, it take Models to observe and ViewHandles to apply the model states into UIViews.

The subscriptions of unidirectional data binding will be disposed when the ViewBinding is released.
